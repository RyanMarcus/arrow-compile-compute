An experimental project for testing LLVM-compiled kernels for Arrow.

Compared to [arrow-rs](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs), this crate:

* ➕ Operates on *recursive* Arrow arrays, for example, a dictionary-of-dictionary array.
* ➕ Casting to and from arbitrary Arrow array types, like casting a dictionary to a run-end encoded array.
* ➕ Always uses the SIMD operations available at runtime, no recompilation required.
* ➖ Requires LLVM as a dependency.
* ➖ Startup overhead the first time a kernel is invoked (~10s of ms).
* ➖ Not production ready -- this is a research project.
